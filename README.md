# IMation
Picture to Text Translation using React Native and Expo

## HowTo
Take a picture using the app and it connects to Google Vision and Translation APIs to translate latin scripts type languages to any desired language. The app automatically detects the language in the picture and does the conversion. The current supported languages are given here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_writing_system#Latin_script

## Example Usage
### Take a snapshot and view the results
<img src ="picture.PNG" align="left" width="350px"/>
<img src ="translation.PNG" align="center" width="350px"/>

## Roadmap
=> Faster Image Processing (Image-to-translated-text currently slow)

=> Better Layout

=> Add local Storage for App

=> Support for Cyrillic and other language scripts
